# About
This is Module 10 Challenge by the Ohio State University bootcamp. This project is about letting the users generate a logo by answering a series of questions in the command line.

## Description
When the user initiate the the index.js file using the command line 'node index.js', there will be a series of prompts that the user will have to answer. Upon answering all the questions, a 'logo.svg' file will be created in the 'Output' folder. A number of tests were also prepared to test different areas of the code, and users can initiate the test by typing 'npm test' in the command line, providing they have the 'jest' package installed and set the script to 'test: "jest"'.
